\subsection{Data analysis}

Statistical analysis of the experimental results with respect to samples characterization and BMP potential was carried out by means of R software \cite{nokey_e6883}. A one-way ANOVA test was implemented to evaluate the different growth stages, after which post hoc multiple comparison was carried out by means of the Tukey HSD test at the 95\% confidence level. All values correspond to the mean of two independent replicates (n =2) Â± standard deviation (SD).
