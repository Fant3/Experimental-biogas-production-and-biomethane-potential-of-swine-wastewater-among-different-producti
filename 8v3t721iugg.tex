\subsection{Experimental BMP}
The cumulative biogas production, daily biogas production, and methane content in the biogas produced during the digestion of SW from different production stages under mesophilic conditions are presented in Fig.1, Fig.2, and Fig.3. Gestation wastewater presented the largest biogas potential after 54 days (500.35 (0.13) ml.g VS added\textsuperscript{-1}) followed by fattening (385.50 (333.71) ml.g VS added\textsuperscript{-1}) and weaners (250.42 (0.37) ml.g VS added\textsuperscript{-1}) wastewater. Statistical analysis on the cumulative biogas production showed no significant different
