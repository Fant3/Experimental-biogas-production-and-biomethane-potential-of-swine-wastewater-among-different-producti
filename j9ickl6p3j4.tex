\subsection{Characteristics of swine wastewater samples}
The characteristics of SW samples from different production stages in the studied farm is presented in Table 3. Regarding the different production stages, pH was 7.83 with some variability; one way ANOVA analysis showed significant differences among production stages with higher pH values for weaning and fattening phases. Also significant was the variation in EC values with a maximum of 8635 \textpm 895 in gestating sows probably due to the presence of salts in diet. In terms of ORP, although no significant differences were obtained among the production stages, more negative ORP values were obtained in farrowing and fattening wastewaters (-55.5 and)
