\subsection{The present study}
The focus of this paper is to determine the methane potential of the available organic waste streams, in order to identify the po- tential energy that could be recovered through the exploitation of AD as an alternative waste treatment within the confines of a full- scale cattle slaughterhouse. This paper assess the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the poultry slaughtering process using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the inadequacies of three parameter sigmoidal kinetic models to accurately describe the methane production kinetics of complex substrates. A number of popular modified bacterial growth curves, Richards, logistical and Gompertz models, were applied to assess their applicability to the different forms of methane production kinetics observed from the BMP assays.
