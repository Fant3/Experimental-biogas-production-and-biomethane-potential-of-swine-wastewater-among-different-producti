\subsection{The present study}
The focus of this paper is to determine the methane potential of
the available organic waste streams, in order to identify the po- tential energy that could be recovered through the exploitation of AD as an alternative waste treatment within the confines of a full- scale cattle slaughterhouse. The potential energy recovery is assessed in terms of subsidising the process energy of the slaugh- tering facility and evaluating the degree of energy self-sufficiency that could be achieved. Advancing from the boundaries of a sin- gle slaughtering facility, the cattle slaughtering sector in Ireland is also appraised. The contribution of the potential renewable energy generation from the entire sector is assessed in terms of progress towards meeting Irelands 2020 renewable energy targets, RES of 16%, mandated under the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/ EC) [16]
