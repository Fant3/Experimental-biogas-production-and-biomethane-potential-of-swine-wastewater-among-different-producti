\subsection{The present study}
The focus of this paper is to characterize and evaluate the biogas potential of swine waste streams from dif streams in order to explore the potential energy that could be recovered via AD in a large scale pig farm. This paper assess the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the poultry slaughtering process using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the inadequacies of three parameter sigmoidal kinetic models to accurately describe the methane production kinetics of complex substrates. A number of popular modified bacterial growth curves, Richards, logistical and Gompertz models, were applied to assess their applicability to the different forms of methane production kinetics observed from the BMP assays.
