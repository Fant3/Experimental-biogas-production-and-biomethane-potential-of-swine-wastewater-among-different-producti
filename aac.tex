\subsection{The present study}
This paper is focused on the characterization and evaluation of the biomethane potential of swine waste streams from different production stages. The study specifically assesses the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the pig farm using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the inadequacy of AD as a full scale treatment technology of specially dirty effluents whilwithout devaluing its importance as an energy recovery technology in a large scale pig farm providing valuable insights for a future in situ implementation of the technology.
