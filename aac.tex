\subsection{The present study}
This paper is focused on the characterization and evaluation of the biomethane potential of swine waste streams from different production stages. The study specifically assesses the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the pig farm using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the value of AD in terms of the energy that could potentially be recovered via AD in a large scale pig farm.. A number of popular modified bacterial growth curves, Richards, logistical and Gompertz models, were applied to assess their applicability to the different forms of methane production kinetics observed from the BMP assays.
