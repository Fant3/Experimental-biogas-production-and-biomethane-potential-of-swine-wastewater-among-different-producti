\subsection{The present study}
This paper is focused on the characterization and evaluation of the biomethane potential of swine waste streams from different production stages. The study specifically assesses the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the pig farm using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the innefi of AD in terms of the energy recovery in a large scale pig farm providing a framework of data valuable for a future in situ implementation of the technology.
