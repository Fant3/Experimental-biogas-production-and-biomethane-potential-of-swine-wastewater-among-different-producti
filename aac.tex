\subsection{The present study}
This paper is focused on the characterization and evaluation of the biomethane potential of swine waste streams from different production stages. The study specifically assesses the degradation patterns of the organic waste streams produced in the pig farm using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the inadequacy of AD as a full scale treatment technology of specially dirty effluents while simultaneously providing valuable insights for a future in situ implementation of the technology, in this way not devaluing its importance as an energy recovery tool for the agro
