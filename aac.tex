\subsection{The present study}
This paper is focused on the characterization and evaluation of biogas and biomethane potential of swine-derived effluents from different production stages. The study specifically assesses the degradation patterns of the swine waste streams produced in a large scale farm using BMP assays and kinetic modelling. The primary aim is to demonstrate the inadequacy of AD as a full scale treatment technology of specially dirty effluents such as swine wastewater while simultaneously providing valuable insights for a future \textit{in situ} implementation of the technology, in this way not devaluing its importance as an energy recovery tool for agroindustries.
