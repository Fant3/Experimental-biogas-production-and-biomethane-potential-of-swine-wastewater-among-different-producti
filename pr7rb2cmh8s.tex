\subsection{Kinetic model}
Cumulative biogas yield obtained from the experimental assays was used to fit a kinetic model of biogas production with the modeled results for the best fit plotted against the experimental cumulative biogas production in Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6 depending on the growth stage. The parameters determined from the regression analysis as well as the R\textsuperscript{2}, F-statistic, p-value, and the difference bw
Concerning the kinetics of the process, the biogas production of the microorganisms tipically displayed a lag phase in which the bacterial cells modified their physiological state to adapt to the environment inside the reactor and began multiplying. The developed biosystem further degrades volatile solids into biogas with an exponential phase and a final saturation phase in a reverse L-shape curve typical of simple organic substrates.
