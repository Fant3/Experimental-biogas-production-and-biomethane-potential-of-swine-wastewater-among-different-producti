\subsection{Kinetic model}
Cumulative biogas yield production obtained from the experimental assays was used to fit a kinetic model of biogas production with the modeled results for the best fit plotted against the experimental cumulative biogas production in Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6 depending on the growth stage.
Concerning the kinetics of the process, the biogas production of the microorganisms tipically displayed a lag phase in which the bacterial cells modified their physiological state to adapt to the environment inside the reactor and bra
