\subsection{Kinetic model}
Cumulative biogas yield obtained from the experimental assays was used to fit a kinetic model of biogas production with the modeled results found to have the best fit plotted against the experimental cumulative biogas production in Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6 depending on the growth stage. The parameters determined in the optimization process as well as statistical indicators and the difference between the predicted and experimental biogas production are presented in Table 6.
Concerning the kinetics of the process, the biogas production of the microorganisms typically displayed a lag phase in which the bacterial cells modified their physiological state to adapt to the environment inside the reactor. The developed biosystem then multiplied and degraded volatile solids into biogas with an exponential phase and a final stationary phase in a reverse L-shape curve typical of simple organic substrates. As seen in the figures, the curves for gestation, fattening and weaners wastewaters all show a similar trend upon visual inspection, i.e., the chosen model adequately describes the biogas production from the tested effluents. Calculated lag time (λ) was found to be about 2 days for fatteningsows, varying from 6 and almost 10 days for Gestation and Weaners waste streams. The high bioavailability of readily degradable organics in Fattening wastewaters can be the reason for the shorter lag phase. No significant difference in λ values were found for gestating and fattening wastewaters but the lag phase for weaners was significantly higher than that for fattening. To
