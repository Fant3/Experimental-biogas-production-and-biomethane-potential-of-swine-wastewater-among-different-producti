\subsection{Kinetic model}
Cumulative biogas yield production obtained from the experimental assays was used to fit a kinetic model of biogas production through three different mathematical models. The best model results are plotted against the experimental cumulative biogas production in Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6 for gestation, fattening, and weaners wastewater, respectively.
Concerning the kinetics of the process
