\subsection{Theoretical BMP and biodegradability}
In order to evaluate the biodegradability of the tested wastewaters, the specific methane yield obtained in the BMP assay was compared with the theoretical methane yield estimated using its elemental composition and organics content measured via COD. Table 6 presents theoretical results (BMP\textsubscript{th}, BMP\textsubscript{thCOD}, and CH\textsubscript{4th} ) using both methodologies, as well as experimental results (specific methane yields and CH\textsubscript{4exp}) and  biodegradability.  Theoretical methane potential calculation results showed that wastewaters from the fattening stage (BMP\textsubscript{th} = 653.46, BMP\textsubscript{thCOD} = 991.47) had a higher thoeretical potential than gestation (BMP\textsubscript{th} = 487.65, BMP\textsubscript{thCOD} = 471.69) or weaners (BMP\textsubscript{th} = 374.98, BMP\textsubscript{thCOD} = 618.84) wastewater. In general, the theoretical results obtained from elemental composition presented a better agreement with the experimental results. The biodegradability of gestation, fattening, and weaners wastewater
