\subsection{Theoretical BMP and biodegradability}
In order to evaluate the biodegradability of the tested wastewaters, the specific methane yield obtained in the BMP assay was compared with the theoretical methane yield estimated using its elemental composition and organics content measured via COD. Table 6 presents the experimental specific methane yields and theoretical results using both methodologies, as well as biodegradability and
