Effluent streams originating from swine production can be a major cause of point-source pollution and very dangerous for the surrounding environment and human health. In this work, biogas and biomethane production were assessed in a large scale farm using BMP assays in order to investigate the suitability of anaerobic digestion as a treatment technology and energy recovery tool. Kinetic modelling of wastewaters from different production stages was also evaluated in order to better understand the
