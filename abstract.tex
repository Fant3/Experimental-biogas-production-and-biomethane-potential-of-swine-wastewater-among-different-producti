Effluent streams originating from swine production can be a major cause of point-source pollution and very dangerous for the surrounding environment and human health. In this work, biogas and biomethane production The methane potential and degradation patterns under mesophilic conditions were assessed using Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) assays.
