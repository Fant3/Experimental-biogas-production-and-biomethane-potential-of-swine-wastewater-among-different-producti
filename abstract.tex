Effluent streams originating from swine production can be a major cause of point-source pollution and very dangerous for the surrounding environment: finding a solution for on farm treatment and processing of wastewaters is therefore essential. In this work, biogas and biomethane potential of swine-derived effluents was assessed under mesophilic among different production stages using BMP assays in order to investigate the suitability of anaerobic digestion as a treatment technology and energy recovery tool. Anaerobic characteristics and kinetic modelling of wastewaters from different production stages was also evaluated in order to better understand the degradation patterns of each waste stream.
