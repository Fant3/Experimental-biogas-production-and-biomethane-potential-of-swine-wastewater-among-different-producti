\section{Conclusion}
In this study liquid swine wastes from a swine farm were anaerobically digested in BMP assays under mesophilic conditions. The methane yields achieved, ranging from 261.35 to 594.59mLCH4 gVSâˆ’1, are encouraging for potential energy generation from the poultry slaughtering industry.
