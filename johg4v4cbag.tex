\section{Conclusion}
In this study liquid swine wastes from a farrow to finish farm were anaerobically digested under mesophilic conditions. The biogas and biomethane yields achieved, ranging from 261.35 to 594.59mLCH4 gVS−1, are encouraging for on farm energy generation and may provide an important contributor to alleviate the increasing energy demand within the industry.
