\section{Conclusion}
In this study liquid swine wastes from a farrow to finish farm were anaerobically digested under mesophilic conditions. In general, the characteristics of gestation, weaners, fattening, and farrowing were significantly different due to different feed strategy and nutrient digest- ibility at different growth stages. The specific methane yields for each substrate wastewater ranged from 293.9 mLCH\textsubscript{4}.gVS added\textsuperscript{-1} for gestation and 172.4 mLCH\textsubscript{4}.gVS added\textsuperscript{-1} for weaners. T are encouraging for on farm energy generation and may provide an important contributor to alleviate the increasing energy demand within the industry. A minimum HRT of 21–24 days is recommended to prevent biomass washout and an HRT of 41–53 days is recom- mended for effective treatment of FW silages under continuous operations. The modified Gompertz model fitted the experimental results better than a first-order kinetic model
