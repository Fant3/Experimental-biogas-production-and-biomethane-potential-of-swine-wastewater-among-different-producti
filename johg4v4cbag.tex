\section{Conclusion}
In this study liquid swine wastes from a farrow to finish farm were anaerobically digested under mesophilic conditions. The biogas and biomethane yields achieved, ranging from 261.35 to 594.59mLCH4 gVSâˆ’1, are encouraging for potential energy generation from the poultry slaughtering industry.
