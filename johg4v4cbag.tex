\section{Conclusion}
In this study liquid swine wastes from a farrow to finish farm were anaerobically digested under mesophilic conditions. The The specific methane yield for each substrate wastewater ranged from 248.0 mLCH\textsubscript{4}.gVS added\textsuperscript{-1}, 293.9 mLCH\textsubscript{4}.gVS added\textsuperscript{-1}, and 172.4 Â± 1.62 mLCH\textsubscript{4}.gVS added\textsuperscript{-1} for fattening, gestation, and weaners wastewater, are encouraging for on farm energy generation and may provide an important contributor to alleviate the increasing energy demand within the industry.
