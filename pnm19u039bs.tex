\subsection{Kinetic modelling}
Biogas production data was fitted against three classical model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards) using grofit R package \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit software was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling. It enables a semiautomatic fitting of the parameters describing most growth processes which typically present a phase of slow gas production (lag phase) followed by a period of rapid gas production and then by a stationary phase. Generally, kinetics of biogas production is assumed to be proportional to microbial activity in the digester with little adjustments between models. The logistic model, for example, assumes the rate of biogas production to have correspondence to the microbial activity in the digester; the Gompertz model folobut with fermentation efficiency decreasing with time, following first order kinetics. The best fitting model is automatically chosen by grofit using the Akaike criterion \cite{Hasenbrink_2006}. In this study, the fitting of modified sigmoidal models (see \cite{Zwietering1990} for details) to the cumulative biogas production curves with respect to time allows the determination of parameters with biological meaning such as the maximum biogas yield ($A$), the maximum rate of biogas production ($μ_m$), as well as the length of the lag phase ($λ$), as described below for the different models \cite{Zwietering1990,Ware_2017,Alta__2009}.

Logistic model

\(y=\frac{A}{\left(1+\exp\left[\frac{4\mu_m}{A\left(\lambda-t\right)+2}\right]\right)}\)

Gompertz model

\(y=A.\exp\left[-\exp\left(\frac{\mu_me}{A}\left(\lambda-t\right)+1\right)\right]\)

Richards model

\(y=\frac{A}{\left(1+d\ .\exp\left(1+d\right).\exp\left[\frac{\mu_m}{A}.\ \left(1+d\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{d}\right).\left(\lambda-t\right)\right]\right)^{\left(-\frac{1}{d}\right)}}\)


where $y$ is the cumulative biogas production (mL.gVS\textsuperscript{−1}), $A$ is the maximum biogas production potential (mL.gVS added\textsuperscript{−1}), $μ_m$ the maximum rate of methane production rate (mL.gVS added\textsuperscript{−1}).d\textsuperscript{−1}), $e$ is Euler's constant, $λ$: lag-phase (days), $t$ is the incubation time (days), and $d$ the shape coefficient.
