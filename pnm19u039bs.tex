\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against four model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, modified Gompertz and Richards) using grofit R package \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit software was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling. It enables a semiautomatic fitting of the three  parameters describing the typical bacterial growth curves 1) the phase of slow gas production (lag phase), 2) the phase of rapid gas production (exponential phase), 3) the phase in which the rate of gas production slows and eventually reaches zero (asymptotic or stationary phase).’ growth rate (μ), length of lag phase (λ), and maximum cell growth (A) with the best model automatically chosen using the Akaike criterion \cite{Hasenbrink_2006}. In this study
