\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against four model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, modified Gompertz and Richards) using grofit R package \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit software was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling. It enables a semiautomatic fitting of the parameters describing the growth process which typically presents a phase of slow gas production (lag phase), a phase of rapid gas production (exponential phase), will typically present as a sigmoidal curve as shown in Fig. 2, with a lag phase just after t = 0 followed by exponential phase and then by a stationary phasestationary phase).’ growth rate (μ), length of lag phase (λ), and maximum cell growth (A) with the best model automatically chosen using the Akaike criterion \cite{Hasenbrink_2006}.
