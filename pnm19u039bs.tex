\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against three model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards) using grofit software \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit  was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions fitting data to different parametric models and in addition providing a model free spline method to circumvent systematic errors that might
occur \cite{Kahm_2010}.
