\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against three model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards) using grofit software \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit package was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling.
