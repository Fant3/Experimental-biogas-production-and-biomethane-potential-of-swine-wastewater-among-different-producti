\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against four model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, modified Gompert and Richards) using grofit R package \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit software was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling. It enables a semiautomatic fitting of the parameters’ growth rate (μ), length of lag phase (λ), and maximum cell growth (A) with the best model automatically chosen using the Akaike criterion \cite{Hasenbrink_2006}.
