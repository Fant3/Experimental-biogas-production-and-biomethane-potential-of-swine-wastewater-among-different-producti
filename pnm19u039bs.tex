\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against four model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, modified Gompertz and Richards) using grofit R package \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit software was developed to describe many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions but has rarely been applied to biogas production modelling. It enables a semiautomatic fitting of the parameters describing the growth process which typically presents a phase of slow gas production (lag phase) followed by a period of rapid gas production and then by a stationary phase. In this study, the fitting of sigmoidal models to the cumulative methane production curves obtained from BMPs allows the determination of maximum methane yield was reached (A), the maximum rate of methane production (μm) as well as the duration of the lag phase (λ). growth rate (μ), length of lag phase (λ), and maximum cell growth (A) with the best model automatically chosen using the Akaike criterion \cite{Hasenbrink_2006}.
