\subsection{Kinetic models}
Biogas production data was fitted against three model formulas for microbial growth (Logistic, Gompertz, and Richards) using grofit software \cite{Kahm_2010}. Grofit was developed to fit many biological growth curves obtained under different conditions fits data to different parametric models and in
addition provides a model free spline method to circumvent systematic errors that might
occur
